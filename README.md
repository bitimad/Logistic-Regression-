# Logistic-Regression-
Building a logistic regression algorithm from scratch 

Logistic regression is a linear model for classification. In this model, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled using a logistic function that gives a value between 1 and 0.

Just like a Linear Regression model, a Logistic Regression model computes a weighted sum of the input features (plus a bias term), but instead of outputting the result directly like the Linear Regression model does, it outputs the logistic of this result, which is the result of the sigmoid function.
If the logistic is strictly inferior to 0.5 we predict class 0 , else we predict class 1.

This is a beginners code that directly goes through the essetials of logistic regression , as in calculating the sigmoid function , training and fitting process.
